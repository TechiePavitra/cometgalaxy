Hello Gemini,
You made this educational website sick!,
i need a major update, which rebrands the website and name,
the new name is "CometGalaxy", now there is only one subject "Mathematics",
with this major update we brings:
1. Mathematics
2. Science
  - Physics (for now)
3. Computer Science

in homepage after clicking on get started there will be subject cards to select, now the CometGalaxy is a whole study platform


add a custom book viewer instead of normal browser pdf viewer, with sleek icons and features such as pen and eraser and other things

with this major update, the look of site has been changed majorly
- floating planet or anything related to space in homepage (generate images using AI)
- the core theme of website must be change techie vibe to scientific vibes with new computer science and other references

last but most importart
what if we merge my old project called "studypro" (folder name: studypro-webapp) with this site?
the webapp has a problem that the webapp cannot generate paper in gujarati language so fix it!, add a button in homepage.

improve everything and merge two apps in one!
